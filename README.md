# Data Visualization with Pandas

In this lesson we will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create simple plots. We'll cover plotting line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms, and how to manipulate the style of your plots with Matplotlib and Plotly.

## Objectives:
By the end of this lesson students will be able to:
- Practice using different types of plots.
- Use Pandas methods for plotting.
- Create line plots, bar plots, histograms, and box plots.
- Know when to use Seaborn or advanced Matplotlib

## What we'll practice:
- What are continuous and categorical variables? Using pandas built-in plotting functionality.
- Learn about various types of pandas plots using matplotlib
- use matplotlib to visualize distributions and relationships with continuous and categorical variables
- imitate a real-world example


Documentation can be found at the following sites:

- [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/)
    - The [examples gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) is very helpful.
- [Seaborn Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
    - The [examples gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) is very helpful.

Note, most of the matplotlib tasks can be done by referring to the other notebooks in this lesson. The seaborn tasks are not all covered in this lesson and the documentation may be necessary. Although, in most cases you are asked to use a specific seaborn method so you should be able to figure out what needs to be done without referring to the documentation.
